Entertainers performs for others. They live for having an audience for his or her skills.
 Whether you’re a musician, a circus performer, or a gladiator, you’re equally a sort of entertainer.
 You’re an artist within the sense that you simply live your art through action, not by the thing.
 You stir the hearts and minds of men and ladies together with your performances.

The lifetime of a dancer is all that I ever wanted. At a young age,
 I trained under the best tutors that my parents could afford and that I wanted for nothing. 
I grew up wanting for nothing and being the foremost graceful creature most of the people had ever seen.
 Life took a turn on my behalf of me when my parents lost everything. 
A conman came and swindled them out of everything that they had. We were left on the streets, my fancy tutors were gone, 
and that I had nothing. My parents couldn’t even feed us most nights. I made a decision to run away 
and located a convent that might take me in. There I used to be ready to learn more fluidity and beauty.
