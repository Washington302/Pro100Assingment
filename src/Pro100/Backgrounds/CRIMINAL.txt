Underworld connections – You still have connections to the mobsters, and these contacts help you in times of need, 
whether you need a safe house or to escape for a while. You can rely on these people for almost all the tasks, and they come 
to your aid in some or the other way.

Spy – Your abilities are similar to that of a burglar or smuggler, but you utilize them differently, as an agent,
 which makes all the difference. You might be working for the king or as a private agent after selling the secrets,
 you unearthed.
