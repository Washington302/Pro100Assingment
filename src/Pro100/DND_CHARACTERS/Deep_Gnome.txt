                        *Age*

Deep gnomes are short-lived for gnomes. They mature at the same rate humans do 
and are considered full-grown adultsby 25. 
They live 200 to 250 years, although hard toil 
and the dangers of the Underdark often claim them before
their time.

                        *Alignment*

Svirfneblin believe that survival depends on avoiding 
entanglements with other creatures and not making enemies,
so they favor neutral alignments. They rarely wish others ill,
and they are unlikely to take risks on behalf of others.

   
                        *Size*

A typical svirfneblin stands about 3 to 3Â½ feet tall
 and weighs 80 to 120 pounds. Your size is Small.

You can speak, read, and write Common, Gnomish, and Undercommon.
The svirfneblin dialect is more guttural than surface Gnomish, 
and most svirfneblin know only a little bit of
Common, but those who deal with outsiders 
(and that includes you as an adventurer) 
pick up enough Common to get by in other lands.
